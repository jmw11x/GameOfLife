# GameOfLife
***Most recent working patch is in the master branch***

Implementation of the game of life.

Limited to a 50x50 grid, but all patterns work. You'd have to manually adjust size for a larger grid in the script.js file.

Authors
Script.js :
  -Jacob Wilson -> play(), setShape(), getAlive(), loadAlive(), task(), getNeighbors(), revive(), getActivedCells(), getDeadCells(), updateGrid()
  -Prisilla Martinez -> generate grid function
  -Lucky Phan -> Play 23 and Play1
  -Trien Hong : generation counter

***The final stylings(seen in presentation before demo) had to be reverted to a previous release as they caused errors in the program. Refer to the branches for this stylesheet and ajustedments needed in script.js for a beterr ui. The login pages styling is also avialble in the patched branches.
    -> This was written by Prisilla MArtinez and Alaya Shack.
